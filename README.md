## Quick Start
TODO: replace xx-xx-xx with package name once determined. Determine with team for package name.
```sh
# With npm
npm install --save xx-xx-xx
# With Yarn
yarn add xx-xx-xx
```
Now you can import the `typeDefs` & `resolvers` to add to your GraphQL schema in order to query the markdown content.
```js
// gqlSchema.js
import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools';
import { contentItemTypeDefs, contentItemResolvers } from 'xx-xx-xx';

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs: contentItemTypeDefs,
  resolvers: contentItemResolvers
});

export default schema;
```

Next you will need to setup the process to load the markdown so we can query it via GraphQL.
```js
// server/index.js
import { loadMarkdownIntoDb } from 'xx-xx-xx';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

const serveImagesFromServer = ({ imgPath, contentRoot }) =>
  `/images${imgPath.slice(contentRoot.length)}`;

// Create our options for loading the markdown into our in memory db.
// NOTE: By default images are converted to base64 if no function is passed.
// You shouldn't use base64 in production as it increases the size of images.
const options = {
  contentRoot: `fullpath/to/root/of/content`,
  imageFunc: isProduction ? serveImagesFromServer : null,
};

//*** Example 1 - Promise ***/

// Find all markdown files, process and load them into memory.
loadMarkdownIntoDb(options).then(itemCount => {
  console.log(`DB ready!\n${itemCount} ContentItems loaded!`);
  // Import and start the rest of your app & GraphQL Server.
  import('../startup/server');
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('[loadMarkdownIntoDb]', error);
});

/*** Example 2 - Async/Await ***/
(async () => {
  try {
    // Find all markdown files, process and load them into memory.
    const itemCount = await loadMarkdownIntoDb(options);
    console.log(`DB ready!\n${itemCount} ContentItems loaded!`);

    // Import and start the rest of your app & GraphQL Server.
    import('../imports/startup/server');

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[loadMarkdownIntoDb]', error);
  }
})();
```


## Markdown files

A markdown file contains two distinct sections, the MetaData section and the Markdown section.

```
---
MetaData Section
---

Markdown Section
```

#### MetaData section

The MetaData section contains `key`:`value` pairs. Every Markdown file is required to contain a MetaData section and must contain an `id` and an `groupId` key-value pair.

```md
---
id: myFirstMdFile
groupId: homePage
---
```

#### Markdown section

The Markdown section is placed after the MetaData section and contains your markdown content. The markdown content will be converted into valid HTML when we process all markdown files and store them in memory.
```md
# My First Markdown file

Hello World!
```

#### Putting it all together

```md
---
id: home-content-section-1
groupId: homePage
type: pageContent
title: Wonder Website
description: Wonder Website - Home Page
date: 2017-12-25
---

# Welcome to this wonderful website!

Hello world! Thanks for dropping by to say hello.
```
